# Odin Landing Page

Re-creating an entire webpage from a design provided by The Odin Project. In this repository we are putting the HTML and CSS skills I re-learned from this course and applying it to a sample.

We are going to deploy this webpage using github pages as we are mainly focousing on html, css and vinalla javascript. After this project I will provide a reflections and thank creators for design assets I have used along this journey.

### Reflection

---

After working on this project for two days. I realised I forgot to check my code before deployment. As the styles on my local machine and the styles launched on github pages did not match. When I went to check my code I found out I was using old variable names. This ment that the page rendered incorrectly because it called an old variable name that no longer existed.
