# Odin Landing Page

Re-creating an entire webpage from a design provided by The Odin Project. In this repository we are putting the HTML and CSS skills I re-learned from this course and applying it to a sample.

We are going to deploy this webpage using github pages as we are mainly focousing on html, css and vinalla javascript. After this project I will provide a reflections and thank creators for design assets I have used along this journey.
